                    <p><em>
                        You have always been fascinated by other cultures, from the most ancient and primeval lost lands to the
                        most modern civilizations. By studying other cultures' customs, philosophies, laws, rituals, religious beliefs,
                        languages, and art, you have learned how tribes, empires, and all forms of society in between craft their own
                        destinies and doom. This knowledge came to you not only through books and scrolls, but also through firsthand
                        observation – by visiting far-flung settlements and exploring local histories and customs.
                    </em></p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Cultural Chameleon</h4>
                <p>Before becoming an adventurer, you spent much of your adult life away from your homeland, living among people
                    different from your kin. You came to understand these foreign cultures and the ways of their people, who eventually
                    treated you as one of their own. One culture had more of an influence on you than any other, shaping your beliefs
                    and customs. Choose a race whose culture you've adopted.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Adept Linquist</h4>
                <p>You can communicate with humanoids who don't speak any language you know. You must observe the humanoids interacting
                    with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of important words, expressions, and
                    gestures – enough to communicate on a rudimentary level.</p>

                <h3 class="sectionName">Suggested Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Anthropologists leave behind the societies into which they were born to discover what life ls like in other parts
                    of the world. They seek to see how other races and civilizations survive – or why they did not. Some anthropologists
                    are driven by intellectual curiosity, while others want the fame and recognition that comes with being the first
                    to discover a new people, a lost tribe, or the truth about an ancient empire's downfall.</p>
