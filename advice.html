							<img src="assets/images/D4.jpg" alt="">
							<p>This channel does character builds. As he lays out the build, he also gives suggestions for

								tricks for playing DnD.</p>
							<p>Not typically my go-to source, but he has some good information.</p>

							<p>This channel is all about taking very, very deep dives into the nitty-gritty of DnD.</p>
							<p>While he does focus mainly on "rules as written" types of things, he does make a point of saying the 
								rules are as flexible as your dm and table allow.</p>

							<img src="assets/images/tulok.jpg" alt="">
							<p>This channel chock full of themed characters. For instance, if you wanted to make a DnD character
								based on a MCU character, chances are he already has a version figured out for you.
