						glory of the highest caliber, and riches beyond your wildest dreams.
						It can also be filled with untold horror, abject misery, and death.
						In fact, the latter is most often the case. While death is not to be
						feared, if you hope to survive long enough to obtain even a modicum
						of the riches and glory previously mentioned you will need, at the
						very least, a basic understanding of the ways of the adventurer. You
						will find this information within these pages.</i></b>
