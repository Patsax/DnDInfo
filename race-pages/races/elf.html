                <p><b><em>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.</em></b></p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</li>
                    <li><b>Age.</b> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment.</b> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. Drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</li>
                    <li><b>Size.</b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</li>
                    <li><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                    <li><b>Darkvision.</b> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                    <li><b>Fey Ancestry.</b> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>
                    <li><b>Trance.</b> Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.</li>
                    <li><b>Keen Senses.</b> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</li>
                    <li><b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.</li>

                <p><b><em>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves. The drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They lend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</em></b></p>
                <p><b><em>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.</em></b></p>

Some are prone to melancholy, while others might display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them. Astral elves who don't dwell in the Astral Plane can live to be more than 750 years old.</em></b></p>

                <p><b><em>Elves who dwell in the forest and countryside are known as the Bishtahar. Most live in isolated communities away from other races, though they still trade with them. In fact, much of Kaladesh’s food supply is grown by elves. Bishtahar cultivators grow food, decorative flowers, wood for building, and elaborate living sculptures in their meandering gardens and fields. They use the plane’s ubiquitous technology to foster the growth of plants and animals, utilizing automatons as gardeners and herders, and employing elaborate, nearly invisible systems controlling heat, water, and nutrients.</em></b></p>
                <p><b><em>Elves who forsake technology entirely are called the Tirahar. Some elves with Tirahar sympathies live within cities or farms, but most simply withdraw to the wilder areas of Kaladesh. No more than one in a hundred elves is counted among the Tirahar, and many members of other races are unaware that these reclusive elves even exist.</em></b></p>

Some of them use the techniques of Bishtahar cultivators to grow food on rooftops, towers, and greenways.

                <h3 class="sectionName">Plane Shift: Zendikar</h3>
                <p><b><em>Elves are strongly associated with nature, the magic that flows through their forest homes. Their shamans and druids channel this magic of life and growth, communing with the land or the spirits of the departed. Striving to live in harmony with nature, they celebrate the ties between their communities and their connection with the broader world around them.</em></b></p>
                <p><b><em>The elves of Zendikar have much in common with the elves of other worlds. Your elf character has the following traits.</em></b></p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Wisdom score increases by 2.</li>
                    <li><b>Age.</b> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment.</b> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. Drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</li>
                    <li><b>Size.</b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</li>
                    <li><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                    <li><b>Darkvision.</b> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                    <li><b>Fey Ancestry.</b> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>
                    <li><b>Trance.</b> Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.</li>
                    <li><b>Keen Senses.</b> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</li>
                    <li><b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.</li>
                </ul>
<br>
                <h3 class="subSectionName">Tajuru</h3>
                <p><b><em>The Tajuru nation is the largest of the three main elven nations, concentrated in Murasa and spread across other parts of Zendikar as hundreds of far-flung clans. Tajuru elves are the most open to people of other races, seeing their skills and perspectives as valuable new tools for survival. The Tajuru are also more open to new lifestyles, be it living in a mountaintop citadel or roaming grassy plains.</em></b></p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Charisma score increases by 1.</li>
                    <li><b>Skill Versatility.</b> You gain proficiency in any combination of two skills or tools of your choice.</li>
                </ul>
<br>
                <h3 class="subSectionName">Juraga</h3>
                <p><b><em>The elves of the imperious Joraga nation of Bala Ged have little respect for any other race of Zendikar — or even for other elves. The survival of their nation and its traditions is the Joraga elves’ only goal, and they view the influence of others as a weakness. The Joraga eschew the goods and habits of others, even avoiding the pathways blazed by the Tajuru when possible. Many view the nomadic Joraga clans as little more than bands of roving murderers, but a complex culture hides behind those clans’ aggressive exterior.</em></b></p>

                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</li>

                </ul>
<br>
                <h3 class="subSectionName">Mul Daya</h3>
                <p><b><em>Elves of the Mul Daya nation of Bala Ged are set apart from other elves by their relationship with the spirits of their elven ancestors. To the Mul Daya, the spirit world and the mortal realm are different only in terms of their tangibility. Death and the spirits of the dead are as much a part of the lives of the Mul Daya as is the natural world. This is not a macabre sentiment to the elves; they simply view it as the truest sense of the natural order.</em></b></p>
                <p><b><em>Mul Daya elves can often be recognized by their face painting and tattooing. Many Mul Daya decorate their skins with an enwrapping vine motif, and make use of poisons and acids collected at great cost from strange creatures and plants in the depths of Kazandu.</em></b></p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Strength score increases by 1.</li>

                    <li><b>Sunlight Sensitivity.</b> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</li>

When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <a href="../../spell-pages/spells/">hex</a> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <a href="../../spell-pages/spells/darkness.html">darkness</a> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li>
                    <li><b>Elf Weapon Training.</b> You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</li>
