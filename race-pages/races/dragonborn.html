                        <em>Born of the dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful
                        incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as
                        a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Same dragonborn are faithful servants to true
                        dragons, others from the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still other find themselves adrift, with no clear calling
                        in life.</em>

                    <br>
                    <li><b>Age.</b> Dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old
                    human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Alignment.</b> Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side of the other between Good
                    and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bhamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers
                    are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to
                    lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon,
                    who is all alignments at once.</li>
