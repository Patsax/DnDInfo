                <h3>Player's Handbook</h3>
                <p><i>Born of the dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful
                    incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as
                    a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Same dragonborn are faithful servants to true
                    dragons, others from the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still other find themselves adrift, with no clear calling
                    in life.
                </i></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Age.</b>Dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old
                    human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Alignment.</b>Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side of the other between Good
                    and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bhamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers
                    are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to
                    lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon,
                    who is all alignments at once.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Size.</b>Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds.
                    Your size is medium.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Speed.</b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Draconic Ancestry.</b>You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a type of dragon from the list
                    below; this determines the damage and area of your breath weapon, and the type of resistance you gain.</li>

                    which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + you proficiency
                    bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save. The damage increases to 3d6
                    at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th, and 5d6 at 16th. After using your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete
