                    Dwarves don’t understand laziness or shortcuts. Just as a machine must function smoothly at all times, so too
                    an artisan should work steadily and with care. Dwarves take pride in their work ethic, and abhor any attitude or
                    behavior that would undermine the quality of their work. They are more thorough than speedy, and although a dwarf’s
                    work might take longer to complete, its quality makes the time worthwhile. If a job must be done, a dwarf will see
                    that it is done correctly. And when a dwarf repairs a machine, it will work as well as it did when it was first built,
                    if not better — and it will last.

                    Duergar are dwarves whose ancestors were transformed by centuries living in the deepest places of the Underdark.
                    That chthonic realm is saturated with strange magical energy, and over generations, early duergar absorbed traces of it.
                    They were further altered when mind flayers and other Aberrations invaded and performed horrific experiments on them.
                    Fueled by Underdark magic, those experiments left early duergar with psionic powers, which have been passed down to their
                    descendants. In time, they liberated themselves from their aberrant tyrants and forged a new life for themselves in the
                    Underdark and beyond.

                    <p><em>Duergar value toil above all else. Showing emotions other than grim determination or wrath is frowned on in their
                        culture, but they can sometimes seem joyful when at work. They have the typical dwarven appreciation for order,
                        tradition, and impeccable craftsmanship, but their goods are purely utilitarian, disdaining aesthetic or artistic
                        value.</em></p>
