                <p><b><em>Shifters are sometimes called weretouched, as they are descendants of people who contracted full or partial lycanthropy. Humanoids with a bestial aspect, shifters can’t fully change shape, but they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features by entering a state they call shifting.</em></b></p>
                <p><b><em>Shifters are similar to humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter’s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.</em></b></p>
                <p><b><em>Most shifters resemble a particular kind of lycanthrope. You can choose the kind of lycanthrope in your past, or you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Lycanthrope Ancestor table. The table also provides a suggestion for the Shifting option you might have as a result of your ancestry.</em></b></p>

                <p><b><em>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features – a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife’s edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?</em></b></p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li><b>Beasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn and thick-skinned.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Longtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Swiftstride are often predatory and feline, but a swiftstride could also be a cunning rat who darts through the shadows.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Wildhunt shifters are born from any creature that tracks its prey.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Age.</b> Shifters are quick to mature both physically and emotionally, reaching young adulthood at age 10. They rarely live to be more than 70 years old.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment.</b> Shifters tend toward neutrality, being more focused on survival than concepts of good and evil. A love of personal freedom can drive shifters toward chaotic alignments.</li>
                    <li><b>Size.</b> Shifters range from 5 to almost 7 feet tall, depending on their subrace. Your size is Medium.</li>
                    <li><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                    <li><b>Darkvision.</b> You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                    <li><b>Keen Senses.</b> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</li>
                    <li><b>Shifting.</b> As a bonus action, you can assume a more bestial appearance. This transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you revert to your normal appearance as a bonus action. When you shift, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You also gain benefits that depend on your shifter subrace, described below. Once you shift, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
                    <li><b>Languages.</b> You can read and write Common.</li>
                    <li><b>Subrace.</b> The beast within shapes each shifter physically and mentally. The four major subraces of shifter include beasthide, longtooth, switftstride, and wildhunt. Choose a subrace for your shifter.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="subSectionName">Beasthide</h3>
                <p><b><em>Stoic and solid, a beasthide shifter draws strength and stability from the beast within. Beasthide shifters are typically tied to the bear or the boar, but any creature known for its toughness could apply.</em></b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.</li>

                <h3 class="subSectionName">Longtooth</h3>
                <p><b><em>Longtooth shifters are fierce and aggressive, but they form deep bonds with their friends. Many longtooth shifters have canine traits that become more pronounced as they shift, but they might instead draw on tigers, hyenas, or other predators.</em></b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</li>

                <h3 class="subSectionName">Swiftstride</h3>
                <p><b><em>Swiftstride shifters are graceful and quick. Typically feline in nature, swiftstride shifters are often aloof and difficult to pin down physically or socially.</em></b></p>

                </ul>

                <h3 class="subSectionName">Wildhunt</h3>
                <p><b><em>Wildhunt shifters are sharp and insightful. Some are constantly alert, ever wary for possible threats. Others focus on their intuition, searching within. Wildhunt shifters are excellent hunters, and they also tend to become the spiritual leaders of shifter communities.</em></b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Wisdom score increases by 2.</li>

                    <li><b>Mark the Scent.</b> As a bonus action, you can mark one creature you can see within 10 feet of you. Until the end of your next long rest, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make to find the marked creature, and you always know the location of that creature if it is within 60 feet of you. You can’t use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
                    <li><b>Shifting Feature.</b> While shifted, you have advantage on Wisdom checks.</li>
                </ul>
