                <p><b><em>Tortles have a saying: “We wear our homes on our backs.” These turtle folk live on many worlds, most often journeying up and down coasts, along waterways, and across the sea. Tortles don’t have a unified story of how they were created, but they all have a sense of being mystically connected to the natural world. Carrying their shelter on their backs gives tortles a special feeling of security wherever they go, for even if they visit a far, unknown country, they have a place to lay their heads.</em></b></p>
                <p><b><em>Tortles exhibit the same range of coloration and patterns found among turtles, and many tortles enjoy adorning their shells in distinctive ways.</em></b></p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.</li>
                    <li><b>Creature Type.</b> You are a Humanoid.</li>
                    <li><b>Size.</b> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.</li>
                    <li><b>Speed.</b> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</li>
                    <li><b>Claws.</b> You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</li>
                    <li><b>Hold Breath.</b> You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.</li>
                    <li><b>Natural Armor.</b> Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). You can’t wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.</li>
                    <li><b>Nature's Intuition.</b> Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.</li>
                    <li><b>Shell Defense.</b> You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can’t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can’t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</li>
                    <li><b>Languages.</b> Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The Player’s Handbook offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.</li>
