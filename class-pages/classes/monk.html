					<h3 class="sectionName">Class Features</h3>
					<p>As a(n) Monk, you gain the following class features</p>

					<h4 class="subSectionName">Hit Points</h4>
					<p>
						<b>Hit Dice:</b> 1d8 per Monk level <br />
						<b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 8 + your Constitution modifier
						<br />
						<b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution
						modifier per Monk level after 1st
					</p>

					<h4 class="subSectionName">Proficiencies</h4>
					<p>
						<b>Armor:</b> None<br />
						<b>Weapons:</b> Simple Weapons, Shortswords<br />
						<b>Tools:</b> Choose one type of Artisan's tools or one Musical
						Instrument<br />
						<b>Saving Throws:</b> Strength, Dexterity<br />
						<b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History,
						Insight, Religion, and Stealth
					</p>

					<h4 class="subSectionName">Equipment</h4>
					<p>
						You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
						granted by your background:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>(a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon</li>
						<li>(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack</li>
						<li>10 darts</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Alternatively, you may start with 5d4 starting gold</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Unarmored Defense</h3>
					<p>
						Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not
						wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier +
						your Wisdom modifier.
					</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Martial Arts</h3>
					<p>
						At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
						combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are
						shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the
						two-handed or heavy property.
					</p>
					<p>
						You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding
						only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:
					</p>
					<ul class="sub-lists">
						<li>
							You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and
							damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
						</li>
						<li>
							You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed
							strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels,
							as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
						</li>
						<li>
							When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk
							weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus
							action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with
							a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus
							action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this
							turn.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For
						example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected
						by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter,
						straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk
						weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon on
						the <a href="../../item-pages/weapons.html">Weapons</a> page.
					</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Ki</h3>
					<p>
						Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the
						mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a
						number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points
						you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start
						knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and
						Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in
						this class.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a
						short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your
						expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes
						of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw
						to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated
						as follows:
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Ki save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
						modifier
					</p>
					<ul class="sub-lists">
						<li>
							<b>Flurry of Blows.</b> Immediately after you take the Attack
							action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed
							strikes as a bonus action.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Patient Defense.</b> You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge
							action as a bonus action on your turn.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Step of the Wind.</b> You can spend 1 ki point to take the
							Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your
							jump distance is doubled for the turn.
						</li>
					</ul>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Unarmored Movement</h3>
					<p>
						Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are
						not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when
						you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.
					</p>
					<p>
						At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces
						and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.
					</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Dedicated Weapon (Optional)</h3>
					<p>
						Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as
						monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords.
						Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon,
						focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon
						until you use this feature again.
					</p>
					<p>The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:</p>
					<ul class="sub-lists">
						<li>The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.</li>
						<li>You must be proficient with it.</li>
						<li>It must lack the heavy and special properties.</li>
					</ul>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Monastic Tradition</h3>
					<p>
						When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic
						tradition. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again
						at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

					<h3 class="sectionName">Deflect Missiles</h3>
					<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon
                        attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by
                        1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>
					<p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand
                        and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
                        ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught,
                        as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies,
                        and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Ki-Fueled Attack (Optional)</h3>
					<p>Also at 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack
                        with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
					<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score
                        of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase
                        an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Slow Fall</h3>
					<p>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take
                        by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Quickened Healing (Optional)</h3>
					<p>Also at 4th level, as an action, you can spend 2 ki points and roll a Martial Arts die.
                        You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your proficiency bonus.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Extra Attack</h3>
					<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Stunning Strike</h3>
					<p>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another
                        creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must
                        succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Focused Aim (Optional)</h3>
					<p>Also at 5th level, when you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your
                        attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Ki-Empowered Strikes</h3>
					<p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
                        immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Evasion</h3>
					<p>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a
                        blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
                        make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw,
                        and only half damage if you fail.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Stillness of Mind</h3>
					<p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be
                        charmed or frightened.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Purity of Body</h3>
					<p>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h3>
					<p>Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages.
                        Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Diamond Soul</h3>
					<p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>
					<p>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take
                        the second result.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Timeless Body</h3>
					<p>At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically.
                        You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Empty Body</h3>
					<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time,
                        you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>
					<p>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components.
                        When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.</p>


					<h3 class="sectionName">Perfect Self</h3>
					<p>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>
