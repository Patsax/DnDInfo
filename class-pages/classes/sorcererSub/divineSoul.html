            <h2 class="articleName">Sorcerer: Divine Soul</h2>
            <p>
                <b><em>Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>A Divine Soul, with natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands celestial power, these sorcerers can undermine the existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.</em></b>

            <h3 class="sectionName">Divine Magice</h3>
            <p>Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the <a href="../../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/cleric-spells.html">cleric spell list</a> or the <a href="../../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/sorcerer-spells.html">sorcerer spell list</a>. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</p>
            <p>In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.</p>

            <h3 class="sectionName">Favored by the Gods</h3>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome.</p>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>


            <h3 class="sectionName">Empowered Healing</h3>
            <p>Starting at 6th level, the divine energy coursing through you can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.</p>


            <h3 class="sectionName">Angelic Form</h3>
            <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.</p>
            <p>The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.</p>


            <h3 class="sectionName">Unearthly Recovery</h3>
            <p>At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half of your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.</p>
            <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
