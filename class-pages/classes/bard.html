                        allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master
                        of song, speech, and the magic they contain.</em></p>

                </p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Proficiencies</h4>
                <p>

                </p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Equipment</h4>
                <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(A) a Rapier, (B) a Longsword, or (C) any Simple Weapon</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Alternatively, you may start with 5d4x10 starting gold</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Spellcasting</h3>
                <p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.
                    Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Cantrips</h4>
                <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the
                    <a href="../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/bard-spells.html">Bard spell list</a>.
                    You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
                    column of the Bard table.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Spell Slots</h4>
                <p>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher.
                    To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
                    expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds
                    and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Cure Wounds using either slot.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
                <p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the
                    <a href="../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/bard-spells.html"></a>bard spell list.</p>
                <p>The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of
                    these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when
                    you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace
                    it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour
                    into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
                    ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast
                    and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Ritual Casting</h4>
                <p>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
                <p>You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Bardic Inspiration</h3>
                <p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
                    one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die,
                    a d6.</p>
                <p>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
                    attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use
                    the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the
                    Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</p>
                <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended
                    uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p>Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level,
                    a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Jack of All Trades</h3>
                <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that
                    doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Song of Rest</h3>
                <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during
                    a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of
                    the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</p>
                <p>The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at
                    13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Magical Inspiration (Optional)</h3>
                <p>At 2nd level, if a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points
                    or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled
                    as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Bard College</h3>
                <p>
                    At 3rd level, you you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice. Your choice grants
                    you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

                    As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you
                    and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
                    A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or
                    silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p>

                <p>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from
                    any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table,
                    or a cantrip.</p>
                <p>The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of
                    the Bard table.</p>
                <p>You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Superior Inspiration</h3>
                <p>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.</p>
