            <h2 class="articleName">Monk: Way of the Drunken Master</h2>
            <p>
                <b><em>The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken masterâ€™s erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><em>A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.</em></b>

            <h3 class="sectionName">Bonus Proficiencies</h3>
            <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it. Your martial arts technique mixes combat training with the precision of a dancer and the antics of a jester. You also gain proficiency with brewer's supplies if you don't already have it.</p>


            <h3 class="sectionName">Drunken Technique</h3>
            <p>At 3rd level, you learn how to twist and turn quickly as part of your Flurry of Blows. Whenever you use Flurry of Blows, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the current turn.</p>


            <h3 class="sectionName">Tipsy Sway</h3>
            <p>Starting at 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.</p>
            <ul class="sub-lists">
                <li><b>Leap to Your Feet.</b> When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</li>
                <li><b>Redirect Attack.</b> When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 ki point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3 class="sectionName">Drunkard's Luck</h3>
            <p>Starting at 11th level, you always seem to get a lucky bounce at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.</p>


            <h3 class="sectionName">Intoxicated Frenzy</h3>
            <p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five Flurry of Blows attacks), provided that each Flurry of Blows attack targets a different creature this turn.</p>
