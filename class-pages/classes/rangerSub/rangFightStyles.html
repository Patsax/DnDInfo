            <h2 class="articleName">Ranger: Fighting Styles</h2>

            <p>Starting at level 2, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>

            <ul class="sub-lists">
                <li><b>Archery (PHB).</b> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
                <li><b>Blind Fighting (TCE).</b> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li>
                <li><b>Defense (PHB).</b> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
                <li><b>Druidic Warrior.</b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/druid-spells.html">Druid spell list</a>. They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the <a href="../../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/druid-spells.html">Druid spell list</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Dueling (PHB).</b> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</li>
                <li><b>Thrown Weapon Fighting (TCE).</b> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Two-Weapon Fighting (PHB).</b> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</li>
            </ul>
