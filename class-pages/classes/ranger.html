                <h3 class="sectionName">Favored Enemy</h3>
                <p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting,
                    and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>
                <p>Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons,
                    elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively,
                    you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p>
                <p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on
                    Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>
                <p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by
                    your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>
                <p>You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language,
                    at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of
                    monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Favored Foe (Optional)</h3>
                <p>This 1st-level feature replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature.
                    You gain no benefit from the replaced feature and don't qualify for anything in the game that
                    requires it.</p>
                <p>When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature
                    to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration
                    (as if you were concentrating on a spell).</p>
                <p>The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it,
                    including when you mark it, you increase that damage by 1d4.</p>
                <p>You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your
                    proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p>This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class:
                    to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Natural Explorer</h3>
                <p>Also at 1st level, you are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and
                    are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain:
                    arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make
                    an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is
                    doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>
                <p>While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>
                    <li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>
                    <li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging,
                        navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>
                    <li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
                    <li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
                    <li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and
                        how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Deft Explorer (Optional)</h3>
                <p>This 1st-level feature replaces the Natural Explorer feature. You gain no benefit from
                    the replaced feature and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.</p>
                <p>You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with
                    others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional
                    benefit when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Canny (1st Level)</h4>
                <p>Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check
                    you make using the chosen skill.</p>
                <p>You can also speak, read, and write 2 additional languages of your choice.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Roving (6th Level)</h4>
                <p>Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed
                    equal to your walking speed.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Tireless (10th)</h4>
                <p>As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to
                    1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action
                    a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when
                    you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p>In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Fighting Style</h3>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <ul class="sub-lists">
                    <li><b>Archery.</b> You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</li>
                    <li><b>Blind Fighting.</b> You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li>
                    <li><b>Defense.</b> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
                    <li><b>Druidic Warrior.</b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the 
                    <a href="../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/druid-spells.html"> Druid spell list</a>.
                    They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.
                    Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another
                    cantrip from the
                    <a href="../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/druid-spells.html"> Druid spell list</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>Dueling.</b> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Thrown Weapon Fighting.</b> You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
                        <ul>
                            <li>In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Two-Weapon Fighting.</b> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Spellcasting</h3>
                <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to
                    cast spells,much as a druid does.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
                <p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of
                    1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
                    spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and
                    a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
                    <a href="../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/ranger-spells.html">ranger spell list.</a></p>
                <p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your
                    choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance,
                    when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you
                    know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a
                    level for which you have spell slots.</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your
                    attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
                    In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell
                    you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Spellcasting Focus (Optional)</h4>
                <p>At 2nd level, you can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.
                    A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another
                    special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers,
                    fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Primeval Awareness</h3>
                <p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to
                    focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell
                    slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present
                    within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain):
                    aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t
                    reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Primal Awareness (Optional)</h3>
                <p>This 3rd-level feature replaces the Primeval Awareness feature. You gain no benefit
                    from the replaced feature and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.</p>
                <p>You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional
                    spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as
                    shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number
                    of ranger spells you know.</p>

                <h3 class="sectionName">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
                <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Martial Versatility (Optional)</h3>
                <p>Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to rangers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Extra Attack</h3>
                <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Land's Stride</h3>
                <p>Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>
                <p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the Entangle spell.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Hide in Plain Sight</h3>
                <p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>
                <p>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Nature's Veil (Optional)</h3>
                <p>This 10th-level feature replaces the Hide in Plain Sight feature. You gain no benefit from the replaced feature and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.</p>
                <p>You draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Vanish</h3>
                <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Feral Senses</h3>
                <p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>
                <p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.</p>


                <h3 class="sectionName">Foe Slayer</h3>
                <p>At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>
