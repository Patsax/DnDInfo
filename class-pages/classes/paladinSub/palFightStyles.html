            <h2 class="articleName">Paladin: Fighting Styles</h2>

            <p>Starting at level 2, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>

            <ul class="sub-lists">
                <li><b>Blessed Warrior.</b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/cleric-spells.html">cleric spell list</a>. They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the <a href="../../../spell-pages/class-spell-lists/cleric-spells.html">cleric spell list</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Blind Fighting (TCE).</b> You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</li>
                <li><b>Defense (PHB).</b> While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
                <li><b>Dueling (PHB).</b> When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</li>
                <li><b>Great Weapon Fighting (PHB).</b> When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</li>
                <li><b>Interception (TCE).</b> When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</li>
                <li><b>Protection (PHB).</b> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</li>
