                    <p><em>Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects.
                        They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions.
                        You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.</em></p>

                    <p><em>Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use
                        alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's
                        tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other
                        characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.</em></p>

                <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>any two Simple Weapons</li>

                <h4 class="subSectionName">Optional Rule: Firearm Proficiency</h4>
                <p>
                    The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse.
                    If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> and your artificer has been
                    exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sectionName">Magical Tinkering</h3>
                <p>At 1st level, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability,
                    you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny non-magical object as an action
                    and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</li><br>
                    <li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away.
                        You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than
                        6 seconds long.</li><br>
                    <li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping,
                        or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li><br>
                    <li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words
                        of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.</p>
                <p>You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single
                    object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature
                    at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum,
                    the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>

                <h3 class="sectionName">Spellcasting</h3>
                <p>You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers,
                    you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items
                    and outlandish inventions.</p>
                <h4 class="subSectionName">Tools Required</h4>
                <p>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus - specifically
                    thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool - in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature
                    (meaning the spell has an "M" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.
                    See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.</p>
                <p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions
                    as a spellcasting focus.</p>
                <h4 class="subSectionName">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h4>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="artSpells.html">Artificer spell list</a>.
                    At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>
                <p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip
                    from the <a href="artSpells.html">Artificer spell list</a>.</p>
